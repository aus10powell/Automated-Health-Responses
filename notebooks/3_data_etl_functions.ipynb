I can blink it back into place easily, but I'm not sure if that's a normal sensation or if I should bring it up with my eye doctor. I'm also wondering if this is just a normal thing that happens with astigmatism when you don't have corrective lenses. It's also possible I'm hyper aware of it because it's a fairly novel sensation.
