       "[(\"Recently after every cold I seem to get a persistent dry cough long after the cold is gone. It's just a little tickle in the throat that keeps making me cough. I think it started after a vocal injury (overuse) that has made my throat more sensitive and prone to this after colds. I've tried over the counter meds with dextromethorphan and my doctor has prescribed benzonatate and hydrocodone saying the latter is the strongest stuff they've got, and it did absolutely nothing. I've also tried all the old wives remedies (honey, ginger tea, steam, etc) and no help either. \\n\\nWhat other Rx options are there that I can ask about? I've heard some people get temporary inhalers, would that be an option for me and what are the possible options? Which class/type of inhaler would be the best for treating cough? Steroid? Bronchodialator? Are there any over the counter options? \",\n",

I am in generally good health, blood work is always good, I feel physically healthy, exercise sometimes every day, but at least 5 days a week for about an hour a day. No drinking, smoking, drugs, etc. \\n\\nI have started waking up throughout the night. We have a young daughter going through a difficult diagnosis from this summer and I thought I was handling it as well as could be expected but am thinking I am not doing as good as once thought. I wake very panicked and unable to fall back asleep much of the time, instead pacing the house, cleaning, whatever I can do to keep my mind busy. I have noticed that I started also feeling an urge to hold my breath at times and will do it until my chest burns and aches because it strangely makes me feel a little better in the moment. I also feel like something is off, like something bad will happen to us in our home. I look out the blinds a lot at night, feel very skittish about noises. And I know I am being paranoid, but knowing that doesn't help me stop feeling that way. \\n\\nI am starting to dread night time though. \\n\\nI have never been a depressed or anxious person but does this sound like it could be related to those things, especially given that it has come up as we were dealt a difficult hand? What are the best ways to get through this myself, without taking time away from family/kids? I need to snap out of this, how can I regain control?\\n\\nThank you.\",\n",

       "(\"Greetings , first time here so forgive any mistakes . My brother around 5 moths ago started making these weird noises every 15-30 seconds or so . Regardless of if he's talking , being silent , or even just ideally watching tv . He can seem to slow down the frequency if he tries hard enough , but they come through so it's obviously involuntary at this point . I've made an [ audio recording ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ksr9Cs431T ) to help better understand the noise , since the only description i could give is it sounds like a reverse hiccup or something . Also note that I removed some empty space from the recording so it sounds more frequent then it actually is . General info : Age : 16 Sex : Male Height : 5 ' 5 ' ' Weight : 132 lbs Race : caucasianCausation Location : Not relevant Existing relevant issues : none Audio link : http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ksr9Cs431T\",\n",
